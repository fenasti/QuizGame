## Features

### Header/Navigation

- The Header is fixed to the Nav-bar at the top of the page. It shows the name of the business at the left with a subtitle that explains the main purpose of it and on the right the logo that is also in the favicon element.

- The navigation has 3 main elements: Home, Gallery and Contact Us! Each one directs to a different page. Under every element there is a underline who shows in which page you are on.

- The contrast with the leaf background and the pink tones of the logo and the letters shows the "natural" aspect of the business.

## Solve problems

 During the pages creation i had a problem because of the size of the background an its position wich didn`t allowed scrolling down and the footer didn't stayed at the bottom.

 I contacted student support and they helped me to figured it out by using the devtools and looking for the positions values.

 Finally i figured it out by changing the value of the background and adding other to the footer.

 ## Unsolved Bugs

 I couldn't properly center the elements in the pages. There were always a tiny difference between the paddings from the left and right and wasn't able to fix it after long time trying.
