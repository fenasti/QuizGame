## Solve problems

One of the main problems I had during the project was how to check the array of ojects for the right answer, comparing the option selected and the correct answer option storage in the variable, after many hours i could figure thru many tutorials, that first i should target the event of clicking the selected button and with this event create the function.

Other problem that was related was calling the funtion "checkAnswer" after the click of the selected option because after the first question, the array didn't advance as it clogged.
